# PyInstaller
#  Usually these files are written by a python script from a template
#  before PyInstaller builds the exe, so as a developer you commonly want to
#  rename them (e.g. 'foo.spec' becomes 'foo.exe'),
#  but you almost certainly don't want to rename and commit the spec file
#  itself.

# pipenv
#   According to pypa/pipenv#598, it is recommended to include Pipfile.lock in version control.
#   However, in case of collaboration, if having platform-specific dependencies or dependencies
#   having no cross-platform support, pipenv may install dependencies that don't work, or not
#   install all needed dependencies.
#   Pipfile.lock is *not* cross-platform compatible and should not be included in version control.
#   Therefore, we ignore Pipfile.lock. See https://github.com/hirememorey/glove-basketball.git for details.
