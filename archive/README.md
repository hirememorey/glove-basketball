This directory contains the V1 implementation of this project, a production-ready RAPM (Regularized Adjusted Plus-Minus) model. The project has since pivoted to a new, more ambitious vision focused on systemic inefficiencies.

Please see the top-level `VISION_-AND_STRATEGY.md` for the full context on the project's current direction.

The code and documentation in this archive are no longer in active development but are preserved for historical and methodological reference.
