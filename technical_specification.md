# **PADIM** technical specification

**Version:** 7.0 (Dataset Expansion Complete - RAPM Implementation Ready)

**Status:** DATASET EXPANSION COMPLETE - Successfully processed 491/500 games (98.2% success rate) with 12,141 stints created. All infrastructure validated at scale. Ready for RAPM model implementation.

### 1. Project Overview

This document outlines the technical specification for the **Publicly-Achievable Defensive Impact Model (PADIM)**. The platform's objective is to create a sophisticated and statistically rigorous system for evaluating a basketball player's defensive impact using only publicly available data.

Given the absence of granular player-tracking data in the public domain, this system moves beyond attempts at direct measurement. Instead, it is built to **infer a player's individual impact** by analyzing their effect on team-level outcomes over large, multi-season datasets. The model deconstructs a player's defensive value across three core, measurable domains:

1. **Shot Influence:** A player's inferred impact on opponent shooting efficiency and their direct ability to block shots.
2. **Shot Suppression:** A player's inferred ability to alter an opponent's shot selection by deterring the most valuable shots (those at the rim).
3. **Possession Creation:** A player's ability to actively end opponent possessions and create transition opportunities through steals and other high-effort plays.

### 2. Core Principles

All code and models built for this platform must adhere to the following first principles:

- **Impact is Inferred, Not Directly Observed:** We explicitly acknowledge that with public data, we cannot perfectly measure a defensive process like a shot contest. Our primary goal is to use robust statistical methods to isolate a player's *inferred contribution* to team success.
- **Regression is the Bedrock:** The core of this model is regression analysis (specifically, Regularized Adjusted Plus-Minus). This is the most powerful tool available in the public sphere for disentangling an individual's impact from the quality of their teammates and opponents.
- **No Single-Number Summaries:** Defense is not monolithic. The final output will be a multi-faceted "fingerprint," not a single, reductive metric. This provides a clearer, more honest picture of a player's strengths and weaknesses.
- **Stability and Robustness Over All:** Every metric must be tested for year-over-year stability. A metric that is not stable is likely measuring noise rather than a repeatable skill.

### 3. Domain Understanding Phase (Completed)

**Phase Objective:** Conduct comprehensive first-principles analysis of data sources, timing, possession logic, and quality to establish reliable foundation for RAPM modeling.

#### Key Findings

**✅ Data Infrastructure Excellence:**
- **Timing Alignment:** 100% success rate across test games
- **Data Quality:** Perfect 100/100 quality scores
- **Source Integration:** All NBA API endpoints working reliably
- **Time Conversion:** Robust period-clock to absolute seconds conversion

**✅ Critical Logic Flaw Resolved:**
- **Stint Aggregation Issue:** RESOLVED - Overlaps now properly resolve to 5v5 lineups
- **Root Cause Identified:** GameRotation API captures precise substitution timing (entering/exiting players at same moment)
- **Solution Implemented:** Priority-based resolution algorithm - entering players prioritized over exiting players
- **Impact:** RAPM foundation now valid - can proceed with defensive statistics collection

**✅ Possession Logic Framework:**
- **3-Phase Implementation:** Basic → Intermediate → Advanced possession tracking
- **Event Classification:** Clear rules for possession changes (shots, turnovers, rebounds)
- **Edge Cases Addressed:** Free throws, timeouts, technical fouls, overtime

#### Analysis Scripts Created
- `data_exploration.py`: Comprehensive PBP and rotation data analysis
- `timing_analysis.py`: Precision timing analysis between data sources
- `possession_logic_study.py`: Basketball possession rules and conceptual model
- `data_quality_assessment.py`: Multi-game quality validation framework

### 4. Current Status: Possession-Based Attribution Validated

**✅ PBP Data Granularity Confirmed:** Comprehensive analysis revealed that PBP data has sufficient granularity for possession-level defensive attribution.

#### Key Validation Results

**🟢 PBP Data Capability:**
- **Team Identification:** 100% extraction success for possession-relevant events (380/380)
- **Event Classification:** Clear action types distinguish possession changes
- **Data Completeness:** All critical fields present and usable
- **Current Dataset:** 1 game reprocessed with fixed code, 22 stints, 100% defensive outcome rate (ready for full reprocessing)

**✅ Domain Logic Validated:**
- **Possession Boundaries:** Dead ball substitution requirements ensure clean possession attribution
- **Single Lineup Attribution:** Each possession defended by exactly one lineup
- **Technical Feasibility:** Team extraction from descriptions works reliably
- **Data Quality:** 100/100 quality scores maintained across infrastructure

**✅ Solution Path Confirmed:**
- **Possession-Based Attribution:** Each offensive outcome can be attributed to defensive lineup
- **Statistical Foundation:** Provides path to increase defensive observations per player
- **Measurement Paradigm:** Moves from time-based aggregation to event-based attribution

#### Derisking Phase: COMPLETED ✅
**Critical assumptions validated - ready for RAPM implementation:**

1. **✅ Assumption Validation:** All core assumptions tested and validated
2. **✅ Extraction Accuracy:** 100% team extraction success rate achieved
3. **✅ Free Throw Logic:** Fully defined - free throws belong to foul possession, final FT outcome determines continuation vs. ending
4. **✅ Possession Definition:** Aligned with official NBA methodology
5. **RAPM Stability:** Compare time-based vs. possession-based statistical power
6. **Scale Expansion:** Process additional games after RAPM validation

### 5.1 Free Throw Possession Attribution Logic ✅

**Official NBA Possession Definition Aligned:**
"A possession is the period of time a team has the basketball and the opportunity to score."

**Core Principle:** Free throws are part of the same possession as the foul that caused them.

**Possession Attribution Rules:**

**Shooting Fouls:**
- **Made Final FT:** Possession ends with score, defensive team gets new possession
- **Missed Final FT + Defensive Rebound:** Possession ends, defensive team gets new possession
- **Missed Final FT + Offensive Rebound:** Possession continues with offensive team

**Technical/Flagrant Fouls:**
- Create new defensive possession (fouled team gets ball back)

**Three-Second Violations:**
- Create new defensive possession (fouled team gets ball back)

**And-One Free Throws:**
- Belong to same possession as the triggering basket

**Implementation:** Track foul type + final FT outcome + rebound type to determine possession continuation vs. ending.
